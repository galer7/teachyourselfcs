# 1. Building Abstractions with Procedures

> Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program. People create programs to direct processes. In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.

Lisp was invented by John McCarthy in the 1950s. It uses recursion equations as a model of computation. Lisp stands for "List Processing".

Lisp descriptions of processes, called procedures, can be represented as List data.
